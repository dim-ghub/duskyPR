# Description: True atomic overwrite and rollback of /etc/pacman.conf
# Target:      /etc/pacman.conf
# Ecosystem:   Arch Linux / Hyprland / UWSM
#
# Supported Flags:
#   --auto, auto : Run in non-interactive mode. Bypasses user prompts.
#                  Silently aborts if CachyOS is detected to protect the OS.
#   --revert     : Bypasses generation. Atomically restores the pacman
#                  configuration from /etc/pacman.conf.bak.
